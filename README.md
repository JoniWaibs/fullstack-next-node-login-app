## How to use

![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/docker-%230db7ed.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=docker&logoColor=white)

> For run application, you must have ***Docker*** installed to be able to launch a local container.
> - [Install Docker on Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/) 
> - [Install Docker on Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/) 

## Note

You can't sign up new users, (it was not requested in the challenge) but you can play a lot with the mockedUsers credentials in the `backend/src/mocks/users.json`

For example: You can test the app by logging with this credentials
```JSON
{
  email: Sincere@april.biz,
  password: password,
}
```

## Run app

1 - First, build image and run the development server:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

2 - Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

3 - Enjoy it :rocket:

**Note**
If you dont have Docker installed, you can launch app simply running 
**`yarn dev`** for frontend & **`yarn start-dev`** for backend
If you prefer use npm, you can do it :wink:

## Test

Backend test coverage almost 100%

<div style="display:inline-flex;gap:5px">

</div>

## Nice To Have

Due to lack of time I have not been able to add features that I liked :disappointed: , for example:

:point_right: More tests features,
:point_right: More accessibility features,
:point_right: More preformance features,
:point_right: Responsive designe,
:point_right: Add `keep me signed in` checkbox.
:point_right: Use a DDBB as mongo or mysql.
